## Introduction 

Its clear that you don't have to go too far to see the effects of COVID-19 (also known as Coronavirus) over the last two years. Your house probably has more hand sanitizers than it normally did, you might find N-95 masks laying around which you believed to only find at the doctors or hospitals, and you've probably used the contactless pick-up option at some of your favorite stores. So many changes in such little time. But, has the virus affected the rest of the world in the same way as the United States? How did countries respond to the virus in terms of vaccinations? This project attempts to explore those questions and provide some insight into the world of COVID-19.
